# DocSlot: Doctor Appointment Website ðŸ¥¼
A doctor appointment website build with mongodb, express, reactjs and nodejs.

# ðŸ’¡About this project 
This project is a Doctor Appointment Booking Website, designed to streamline the process of scheduling medical appointments. The platform is divided into three main components: the backend, the frontend, and the admin panel.

Users can easily sign up and log in to the website. After authentication, they gain access to various pages including Home, All Doctors, About, and Contact.

On the All Doctors page, users can filter doctors by specialization to find the most suitable healthcare professional for their needs. Upon selecting a doctor, they are redirected to the doctorâ€™s personal profile page, where they can conveniently choose an available appointment date.

If a user decides to cancel or change an appointment, they can do so from their Profile page, which offers appointment management features.

The admin panel includes several management features. The administrator has the ability to add new doctors, including details such as name, specialization, graduation details, profile picture, and other relevant information.

This project was completed in three weeks, and although it required a significant amount of time and effort, it was a great learning experience. It allowed me to enhance my development skills and gain hands-on experience in building a full-stack web application.
